The Project Leibniz master plan

# Improve existing world codebase
- Motivation: Necessary to prevent rogue hacker or AI or state from destroying civilization as we know it.
- Examples of an initiatives to emulate:
  - HTTPS Everywhere
  - Let's Encrypt
- Examples of initiatives that the world could still use:
  - Secure by default (lets end this "default password" awfulness)
  - Automated test suite / pentesting / vulnerability scans
- Manifest project:
  - [Verified Modules Initiative](https://github.com/VerifiedModules/)

Auxilliary point: demonstrate / convince the world to realize that no software is an island - in reality the borders drawn between different softwares are artificial, and we could benefit from thinking about all the world's software as a single enormous codebase that can be integration tested.

# Improve programmer collaboration
- Motivation: accelerate technological progress by eliminating the non-technical barriers to programming.
- Standardize vocabulary so learning programming and talking to programmers of other languages isn't so crazy
  - Consider the success of RFC 2119
- Create a universal error database (error exchange) with plugins for all IDEs/compilers
- Manifest project:
  - ~~[The Programmer's Thesaurus](https://github.com/project-leibniz/thesaurus)~~ (will do after the universal error database which is more pressing)
  - [Error.Directory](https://github.com/wmhilton/error.directory)
  
Auxilliary goal: Help programmers realize how similar languages are conceptually, building on the transpiler craze to make the next phase not seem totally crazy.

# Make all languages interoperable
- Motivation: accelerate technological progress by eliminating the remaining technical barriers.
- Demonstrate how indentation can be used to embed any language in any other
- Create the first universal parser (based on parser combinators and state machine)
- Demonstrate that interpreters, compilers, linters, static analyizers, spell checkers can all be represented the same way, as semantics applied to an AST. Start the world down a path towards a universal semantic applicator that can do anything in any language.
- Manifest project:
  - [Characteristica Universalis](https://github.com/project-leibniz/cu)

Auxilliary goal: World peace. Harmony. The end of frustration and compromises resulting from fragmented platforms. Facilitate solving the global problems that challenege us.
